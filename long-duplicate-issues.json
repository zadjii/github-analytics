Because of this, fonts had separate fields for \"how big is a character?\" on Windows and all other platforms.\r\n\r\nThat disparity was fixed in approximately 2009 when Windows 7 shipped with DirectWrite, our modern font rendering technology.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, the \"Windows\" measurements are considered _legacy_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Hack font contains the following measurements and flags:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <sTypoAscender value=\"1556\"/>    <!-- modern measurements -->\r\n    <sTypoDescender value=\"-492\"/>\r\n    <usWinAscent value=\"1901\"/>      <!-- legacy measurements -->\r\n    <usWinDescent value=\"483\"/>\r\n    <fsSelection value=\"00000000 01000000\"/>\r\n    <!--                         ^ if this is a 0, use the legacy measurements. if 1, use the modern ones. -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing the legacy measurements, a single cell in this font is 2384 units tall. Following the _modern_ measurements, it is 2048 units tall.\r\n\r\nWT uses DirectWrite, which has a strict interpretation of this flag. It is following the legacy measurements because the font told it to.\r\n\r\nmintty's renderer seems to be behaving out-of-spec:\r\n\r\n> Some legacy applications use the `usWinAscent` and `usWinDescent` values to determine default line spacing. **This is strongly discouraged. The `sTypo*` fields should be used for this purpose.**\r\n> [OS/2 and Windows Metrics Table specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswinascent)\r\n\r\nEmphasis mine. The line measurer in use in mintty appears to be disregarding the discouragement and it results in a tighter line spacing than it should.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt looks like gvim also \"follows the rules\"; the line spacing matches Terminal, even though gvim uses GDI (legacy) for measurement:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189190/92775631-6de85800-f353-11ea-9833-e187da75c8fe.png)\r\n", "id": 690575575}, {"body": "~I am clearly deluded about the vim thing.

I've opened an issue, but the project seems rather inactive at the moment. I'd welcome an option (maybe as temporary workaround) to switch the rendering engine to use legacy measurement --- similar to the way mintty handles it. However, I fully understand that this may not be technically feasible or desired by the devs as it is basically a hack.", "id": 692801732}, {"body": "So, this might not work. If you want to give it a shot, it should result in a version of Hack named `Hack Patched`.\r\n\r\n### prerequisites\r\n\r\nInstall fonttools (in WSL)\r\n\r\n```\r\napt install -yy fonttools\r\n```\r\n\r\nMove to a folder that contains `Hack-Regular.ttf`\r\n\r\n### steps\r\n\r\n```\r\nttx -o Hack-Patched.ttx Hack-Regular.ttf\r\nsed -i -e '/Hack-/s/Hack/HackPatched/g; s/Hack\\b/Hack Patched/g; /fsSelection/s/01000000/11000000/g; /sTypoLineGap/s/410/0/' Hack-Patched.ttx\r\nttx Hack-Patched.ttx\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. decompile the font to xml\r\n2. sed script to do 3 things:\r\n   1.

I wrote tcell to work with Windows console applications (as well as VT applications) in the days before Windows 10 had VT support.\r\n\r\n2. VT events are necessarily limited.  So yes, we can only offer certain key combinations on Windows, whereas for XTerm and similar we wind up not being able to report key presses that are not reported by the system (i.e. those that don't have escape codes associated with them.)  I do generally discourage application authors to avoid reliance on those for that reason, but some application developers prefer to support them where they can, and accept that they can't on other systems.\r\n\r\n3. Window size reporting.  On *nix, we get a SIGWINCH to tell us the window has changed size.  I cannot imagine how we will get that in a Windows app -- do we get a Window resize signal as well?\r\n\r\nYes, this does impose a portability burden.  The tcell application tries to provide for the necessary plumbing so that application authors don't have to worry about this, and it will Just Work regardless of using a Windows (old) console (think Windows 8 or earlier), a new Windows 10 console, Windows Terminal, iTerm (or any of the various alternatives) on macOS, a Linux or FreeBSD console, or an of the various X11 based terminal emulators.\r\n", "id": 679228296}], "title": "mouse events not delivered using conhost mode and vt output"}

Yes, it works OK in Preview 1.1!   \r\n\r\nI did run into a problem.  The preview appears to be handling the keyboard input very slowly.  It could just be an environmental issue on my machine but I suspect it is just that the preview needs some optimizing before release.   When I run the same code outside of Windows Terminal it is much faster.  By default, our code looks for gaps in keyboard input and assumes that the barcode scanner has stopped transmitting if it detects a gap.  The app is configured to detect 100ms gaps which is normally OK, but proved insufficient in this case.  Gap detection is optional and unnecessary if the barcode scanner outputs a LF, CR or CRLF.  When I switched gap detection off, everything worked perfectly, if a little slowly.   I rebooted the barcode scanner, but that made no difference.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for your response, and can I just record how much I like Windows Terminal and what you guys are doing.

I agree that Solarized is bad in this respect.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think there are two issues in Terminal, and I'd like to close this issue and open two new ones.\r\n\r\nThe first is the real underlying problem with this issue, and that is that Terminal interprets the uncolored \"bold\" ANSI sequence as a request for \"briteWhite\", and that is only a reasonable thing to do if the color scheme is light text on a dark background.   For One Half Light, Tango Light, and Solarized Light, text that should be displayed in bold is either invisible or very difficult to see.  Lacking support for bold text, Terminal should simply use the foreground color for bold text.\r\n\r\nThe second issue would resolve the first, if you are willing to consider it, but I am guessing that is less likely.  In src/renderer/vt/VtSequences.cpp, a comment indicates,  \"in fact most terminals display the bright color when displaying bolded text\" and I don't believe that's actually the case.  Some do.  Some make this an optional behavior.  I've seen this behavior described as a \"hack\" for terminals that don't support aixterm ANSI sequences (90-97).  Ideally Terminal should support both bold text and bright text individually, and not substitute one for the other.  If bold can't be supported, it would be better, in my opinion, to simply ignore the bold sequence and use the standard palette for 30-37, and the bright palette for 90-97.  If a survey of other terminal emulators would sway your mind, I'd be happy to determine which ones exhibit which behavior.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this bug doesn't actually have anything to do with Solarized (which admittedly does have a glaring flaw), which may alleviate your regret.  :)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I should go ahead with separating this into two new issues.", "id": 641015474}, {"body": "> The first is the real underlying problem with this issue, and that is that Terminal interprets the uncolored \"bold\" ANSI sequence as a request for \"briteWhite\"\r\n\r\nThat is a genuine bug (issue #2661).\r\n\r\n>  In src/renderer/vt/VtSequences.cpp, a comment indicates, \"in fact most terminals display the bright color when displaying bolded text\" and I don't believe that's actually the case.

This may require a big change to the search algorithm. \r\n> * [ ] Regular expression match. This is a useful search pattern and is implemented in some editors.\r\n> * [ ] Search history. Sometimes users would do the same search for several times, thus, storing the search history is useful.\r\n> * [ ] High-light while you type. Emphasizing all the matches in the buffer with an outline or selection with another color. This provides a clearer view of the searched text.\r\n> * [ ] Add size handle. Some text editors let the user resize the search box, and there is a size handle on the left side of the search box. This helps user when they search for long text.\r\n> * [ ] #5314 Fuzzy Search \r\n\r\n/dup #3920 ", "id": 628212612}, {"body": "Hi!

The basic conclusion is always the same: \r\n\r\n>  It may seem that satisfy everyone is impossible\r\n\r\nWhen we only had <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> as the copy/paste keybindings, users were unhappy. Now that we've added back <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>, users are still unhappy.\r\n\r\nWith the new \"default\" settings in 0.11, the balance we've tried to compromise on is the following:\r\n* <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> are bound in `defaults.json`, and users will need to actually _unbind_ those keys to disable their functionality. \r\n  - These are the keybindings we've always had for copy-paste, so breaking them seemed like a terrible idea\r\n  - Nobody was really complaining about these being used for copy/paste as opposed to something else\r\n* <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> are now listed in new user's `settings.json` file when they create a new settings file.\r\n  - If they don't like them, it's _trivial_ to just delete them from the file. \r\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> will still work if the user deletes the <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> bindings from their `settings.json`\r\n", "id": 621186852}, {"body": "I understand there're tradeoffs. I understand one can fix manually the keybindings by editing settings.json. I understand this was discussed many times before.\r\n\r\nThe point of this issue is to point out a concrete example of very common, wide-spread `vim` functionality that breaks. This is not just \"I don't like Ctrl+V\", it is a problem that almost every vim-user will encounter. Since it's wide-spread, I think, it calls for more special consideration: e.g. big letters in README about this specifically or MessageBox on first launch, or an explicit invitation to change keybindings on the first launch, or sth else.\r\n\r\nThe profile idea would allow users to change multiple keybindings at once without encountering the problems and fixing them one by one. The same motivation applies to Microsoft Visual Studio / IntelliJ etc. If my preset is e.g. \"Gnome Terminal\", I'm sure everything will \"just work\" and have correct expectations about the chosen tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/5638", "id": 621203593}, {"body": "I'm actually having issues with ctrl+shift+v behaving erratically.

Anyways this solved my problem of default profile launching default  settings not the profile GUID I provided.", "id": 619047354}, {"body": "Okay so there are largely two types of settings:\r\n* **Application settings**: these are setting that apply to the _entire_ application, not just a single terminal instance. `showTabsInTitlebar` for example - it doesn't really make sense for one profile to have this set to true and another to set this to false. This setting affects the state of the entire application window, so it's a _global_ setting. Same with `initialPosition`, `initialRows`/`initialCols` - these things affect the initial state of the window _regardless_ of which profile was created.\r\n* **Profile settings**: these are settings that apply to a single instance of a terminal. Things like the font face used by the terminal, the colors, the cursor properties, etc. Each terminal instance within the Windows Terminal window can have different properties that don't affect any of the other terminals running in other tabs or panes.\r\n\r\nThe next tricky part is that some people want to use a bunch of common settings for _all_ their profiles. It's a pain to have to edit all of them by hand, which is why `profiles.defaults` exists. That allows you to set a group of common properties that's applied to _all_ the profiles. \r\n\r\nIf you want more reading, I'd take a look at [UsingJsonSettings.md](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/doc/user-docs/UsingJsonSettings.md#default-settings). For more technical reading, see the [Default Profiles Spec](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/doc/specs/%232325%20-%20Default%20Profile%20Settings.md) or even the [Cascading Settings spec](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/doc/specs/%23754%20-%20Cascading%20Default%20Settings.md)", "id": 619051716}, {"body": "I would expect then that historySize and wordDelimiters would belong in \"defaults\" as (strictly speaking) they're profile settings, not application settings, but they apparently function out at the global (application) scope. Things get fuzzy when you're talking application-scope settings and default-for-all-profiles scope - they're very nearly the same thing, except for the handful of genuine application settings which can't go in any profile settings (including \"defaults\").\r\n\r\nWhat would help is a comment at the global scope that settings here apply to the application (such as size and position), and then the parser could pop up errors about misplaced settings (profile-level settings given at the application scope, while functional, is \"wrong\" - they should be in \"defaults\" instead).", "id": 619056906}, {"body": "Okay so `wordDelimiters` is definitely a weird one that probably should be a profile setting, not a global one.

But for this to work, it's vital that the Terminal communicate back to the host that the request has failed. If you don't do that, the Terminal and conhost get out of sync, and the renderer goes barmy..\r\n\r\n2. Accept the requested size as a kind of virtual window, similar to the way conhost works when the buffer width and window width are different. If the virtual window is larger than the actual window, you'll need to be able to scroll across the viewport, both horizontally and vertically (the latter being kind of tricky to differentiate from the scrollback).\r\n\r\n3. Accept the requested size and actually resize the whole Terminal window to fit, but only if the tab making the request is currently focused. A background tab shouldn't be able to change the size. And as with option 1, it's vital that the resulting sizes are communicated back to the different hosts for each tab.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm in favor of option 3, but I suspect others will disagree, and it may need to be a configurable preference. It's also possible there are other better approaches that I haven't thought of.", "id": 602867730}, {"body": "Ugh, we don't have an issue for handling resize in Terminal?

This is, unfortunately, by design; it's highly conserved across different types of shells (bash, zsh, powershell and CMD all do the same thing) and the behavior of not closing the tab is in line with Ubuntu's terminal: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/4223#issuecomment-574834181", "id": 585998167}, {"body": "Hi,\r\nI agree that not closing the tab/pane on error is correct.

But now that splits are supported, closing a tab might mean loosing work since a tab might contain more than one terminal. There seem to be an action to close a pane [here](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/doc/cascadia/SettingsSchema.md#implemented-commands-and-actions) but this should have better default behavior.\r\n\r\nMy proposal for this would be\r\n\r\n1. Replace the message `[process exited with code 1]` with something like `[process exited with code 1, press <key> to exit]`. Where `key` could be enter, space or another sensible key. And of course implement the functionality of closing the pane/tab when the key is pressed. \r\n2. Have a setting where I can bypass this behavior and close the pane/tab when the shell exits no matter the exit status of the last command. There already exists a `closeOnExit` option but I have it on `always` and the pane/tab does not close.\r\n\r\nOn other related comments like [this one](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/4223#issuecomment-574834181) the default behavior of never closing is suppose to exist to prevent a terminal from closing on startup because of a miss configuration on the shell. This behavior should never be lost even if proposal number 2 gets implemented.\r\n\r\nI know I could place something like this inside my `~/.bash_logout` to achieve what I want but that is just bad UX and specific to bash. This should be handled in the terminal and work with any shell.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nif [ \"$SHLVL\" = 1 ]; then\r\n    [ -x /usr/bin/clear_console ] && /usr/bin/clear_console -q\r\nfi\r\nexit 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there already exist a way to achieve any of my proposals please point me on the right direction.\r\nThanks.\r\n", "id": 601895295}, {"body": "Hey so for the record, we already have a key bound to \"close pane\" by default, and have for some time now :) <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+W</kbd>, which is the default keybinding for `closePane` will try to close the active pane, and if there's only one pane in the tab, it'll just close the tab.

How is it different?\r\n\r\n@DHowett-MSFT if you judge by the title then yes, this is a subset of what's described in #2061, so is anything about having a wrong initial size. However, if you look at the description and most of the comments, #2061 is more about a fixed reduction in `initialRows` (40->37, 27->24, or on my computer, 25->23, 24->22, 22->20, note that the reduction in rows is constant and does not scale with padding), while this issue is more about the relationship between padding and initial size. It seems that, with higher display scaling, padding takes increasingly more rows and columns space from the initial settings (as you can see from my actual behavior section, 4 rows and 1-2 columns per 50 padding). Also, as I said, this issue does not happen if display scaling is set to 100%, whereas #2061 will happen regardless of display scaling.\r\n\r\nSo yes, depending on how you look at things, it may be a duplicate. But if you ask me, it's not.\r\n\r\nActually, I believe the cause of this issue could be that #1152 failed to account for the display scaling.", "id": 569651156}, {"body": "Yea I'm pretty sure this should just be closed as a /dupe of #2061.

So a color can either be default, an index, or an rgb value. You can see the `ColorType` enum here:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/429af0e6fa80412f1e9185845d856e3497a6cf78/src/buffer/out/TextColor.h#L42-L47\r\n\r\nThe narrowing problem, as I understand it, is that these color types are all first converted to a `COLORREF`, and then that `COLORREF` is sometimes \"optimised\" to an index value.

Titles are write-only, and there's only one of them, so everybody on the same machine needs to work together to make sure the title always makes sense.\r\n\r\nMost stock distribution shell configurations include a line that sets or resets the window title after every command; on my installed copy of Ubuntu that happens in `$HOME/.bashrc` line 69 with a crazy escape sequence inserted into the _prompt_.\r\n\r\nIf I suppress that configuration by resetting `PS1` to something that doesn't contain the \"set title\" escape sequence, then run `sc.exe`, the title remains `sc.exe` for all eternity.

So selecting black on white, and then the bold attribute, like this:\r\n\r\n    echo -e \"\\e[30;47m NORMAL \\e[1m BOLD \\e[m\"\r\n\r\nshould be the equivalent of selecting the default colors, and then the bold attribute, like this:\r\n\r\n    echo -e \"\\e[m NORMAL \\e[1m BOLD \\e[m\"\r\n\r\nBut in the latter sequence, the \"bold\" text becomes bright white instead of bright black.

Where terminals usually have 19-color palettes (indexed 16 plus fg/bg/bold), we have 18 narrowed in certain instances to 16.\r\n\r\nRef #2661, plus the bug report I just can't find for \"foreground but bold\".", "id": 535736891}, {"body": "(or, equally likely, we transform 37 into 39, but we don't transform 97 into 1;39 or 99.

It's the exact same colors being used, so surely they should fail in the same way if that were the case?\r\n\r\nMy theory (which I haven't had a chance to investigate) is that the Windows Terminal might be trying to handle the palette mapping exclusively on the terminal side, and not passing that info through to conhost. So conhost still thinks it's working with the default palette (or whatever settings it has), and when you've got a derived color (from the bold attribute), there's no longer a direct link back to the correct color on the Terminal side.\r\n\r\nBtw, I can accept this might still be a dup.

Because the default matches one of the indexed colors, it gets narrowed to the index.\r\n\r\nIf we stop querying the color table in conhost when we need to figure out which index to use to set the color we think we want, we'll start passing through color indices unharmed.\r\n\r\nYou're right that the derived color is being matched against the wrong index, but really we shouldn't be using color index derivations at all. :smile:", "id": 535745374}, {"body": "(sorry, i realized i just said the same thing three times there at the end.)", "id": 535745442}, {"body": "OK, I think I get it now.

There is a conhost.exe spawned with the child process, but the output is not redirected to the pipes.\r\n\r\nSo, I am really at a loss in understanding the correct way of using the ConPTY API.

Editing it is ok but on its best day whatever editor solution they implement in the terminal would be a poor mans vim if they really wan't to keep it \"lightweight\". The thing though is that really the user shouldn't edit the profiles.json from what I understand, its using hard-coded GUID entries for profiles that map to icons which is just a mess to keep up with. It really should be pointing to an enum or something so that the user could just put \"iconType: ubuntu\" or something...and the default shouldn't be set based on the GUID it should just be a profile name, so that you know if you open ubuntu it will have this icon which matches ubuntu distributions. so I would say until the json is agnostic to these kinds of hard coded IDs I wouldn't want a user editing them and I wouldn't be able to trust importing one unless I knew for sure the GUID values would always be the same or just be obfuscated away from the user entirely.

From discussion on #524 is looks like they're headed towards configurable mouse button mappings, so rather than a single \"putty-style\" option I would suggest that:\r\n\r\n 1. I agree unconditionally; this seems likely just a bug.\r\n 2. Copy-on-select should be an option\r\n 3. I agree; this makes sense when tied to the same copy-on-select option IMO -- if the selection represents the clipboard, then it makes sense to clear it if the clipboard changes\r\n 4. Personally I prefer middle-click paste, right-click context menu. I think that's a mouse button mapping option.\r\n 5. I agree, unconditionally. I suspect the current behaviour stems from legacy conhost which clears the selection when you start typing, but it makes a bit more sense there, because in conhost selecting also suspends new output.\r\n\r\nSo I'd propose that rather than \"putty-style\" we have two options: a mouse-binding for what happens when you middle/right-click, and a \"copy-on-select\" option that enables 2, 3, and maybe 5 above.

We wanted to make sure to build a native application so that _in the long run_, the Terminal would have a smaller memory commit and be far more performant than we could ever get with Electron.\r\n\r\nOffice on the other hand has been around for decades and has an enormous team of engineers. I'm not sure what tech stack they're using, but I'm sure that once they got the apps running cross-platform, it was easier to maintain that. Plus, with their larger teams, it's probably easier for them to maintain two different UI stacks (one for Windows and one for OSX). They likely have a team of engineers for the Windows version and a separate team for the Mac version. With the _4_ of us on the Terminal, I'm not sure it's really feasible for us to try and support an entirely separate UI stack. \r\n\r\nIf WinUI, DirectX, and WinRT were available on OSX, then it would be _trivial_ for us to port the Terminal to MacOS.

Replacing any one of them with a cross-platform solution would be an enormous undertaking, if it's possible at all. \r\n\r\nSo you're probably not wrong. There might be replacements for each of those components. We could use (whatever the UI stack on OSX is), OpenGL, and (something?) to replace them.

You may also configure LC_CTYPE to use an UTF-8 locale. Typically VTE based terminal emulators rely on glib's g_unichar_iswide() function while tmux relies on glibc's wcwidth() function. When these two functions disagree, display gets messed up.\r\n\r\n>This can also happen on macOS when using iTerm2 and \"Use Unicode version 9 character widths\" is enabled in Preferences... > Profiles > Text\r\n\r\n>For that reason, the default ~/.tmux.conf.local file stopped using Unicode characters for which width changed in between Unicode 8.0 and 9.0 standards, as well as Emojis.\r\n\r\nThis happens when I ssh into a box with tmux installed. I have not been able to resolve it. It seems to happen with both WSL1 and WSL3 (with Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store). Things get especially screwy when I try to type, because there is a mismatch between where it looks like the cursor is / where it should be and where what I type is being printed.\r\n\r\n![444](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5594521/65820263-c5e68700-e1f4-11e9-941c-8a344442d90e.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I first connect, everything seems normal. Every time the tmux status line updates, it actually pushes everything up one row, duplicating itself. If no commands are input then this will happen until the screen is completely filled. Some things, such as entering vim, will clear the screen, but the process will just start over as long as the tmux status line is present and updating.\r\n\r\nNotice in the image above where \"ls\" is printed - inside of the duplicated status line.

After all if there are already spaces, they either came from the original string and had their attributes set properly when processing VT input, or they came from a previous resize and got the attributes as correctly as possible from existing ones. I think it would yield the expected result more often than basing it on the last non-whitespace.\r\n\r\nAnother idea: You seem to keep track of \\n to avoid joining back explicit separate lines.\r\nI'm not sure how you store the extra VT attributes, but I guess you do not keep the VT sequence and store it in the console text buffer. If you extended the internal equivalent of CHAR_INFO, maybe storing the VT attributes in effect after the string as the attributes of the \\n char can help.\r\nYou already skip them when rendering, but could look for them when you need to insert extra characters on resize to know which attributes to copy to the new characters inserted before them.", "id": 366114211}, {"body": "_From @zadjii-msft on October 30, 2017 15:32_\n\n@PhMajerus No, there's no particular reason.
